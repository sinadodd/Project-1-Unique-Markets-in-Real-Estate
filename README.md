# Project Description and Questions to Answer
We hope to take a deep look at 2 groups, the counties with highest and counties with lowest sale-to-list ratio, specifically focusing on the subject of health. By looking for correlations between various health factors in the high and low regions, we hope to find some trends that don't always align with the usual generalizations of "wealthy" and "poor" which are how choosing counties by median price would look.

# Research questions to answer
How do health factors correlate to real estate demand?

# Hypothesis: 
Higher demand may indicate a higher economic class and therefore a lifestyle which includes better access to healthcare and lower rates of lifestyle-related risks and conditions, such as smoking and obesity.
