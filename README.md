# Project Description/Outline
We hope to take a deep look at 2 groups, the counties with highest and and counties with lowest residential pricing by sq ft, specifically focusing on the subject of health. By looking for correlations between various health factors in the high and low price regions, we hope to find some trends that apply to both, and some to only one.

# Research questions to answer
What healthcare factors correlate with the regions of highest price per sq foot, and lowest? Are they different? Are they the same? Why could this be?

# Datasets to be used
Zillow
County Health Ranking
KFF.org (Kaiser Foundation)
U.S. Census
CDC

# Tools to use
Python, matplotlib, pandas, APIs

# Rough breakdown of tasks
Get data from different sources into CSVs
Data munging (data frames)
Visualizations (e.g. show disparities in regions)
Analysis
